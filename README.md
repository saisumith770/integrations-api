# Integrations API

This is an api to connect to various plaforms like twitch, youtube and many more. More integrations are yet to come. This is a follow up api for my other project called API buisiness logic which is a restful api for user to create accounts and perform general activities on the platform. This api will allow users to connect their accounts and allow us to provide them with extra benifits.
